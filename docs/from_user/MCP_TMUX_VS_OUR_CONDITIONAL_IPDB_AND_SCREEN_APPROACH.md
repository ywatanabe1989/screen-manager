do you think our conditional ipdb and screen has different purposes from the mcp-tmux?EditYes, they serve distinctly different purposes:
mcp-tmux: Generic Terminal Control

Purpose: Give AI agents basic terminal access
Scope: Run commands, capture output, manage sessions
Users: General AI assistants doing various terminal tasks
Debugging approach: Treats debugging as just another terminal command sequence

cipdb + screen-manager: Specialized Debugging Platform

Purpose: Enable sophisticated, multi-agent debugging workflows
Scope: Understand Python/IPython/debugger states, coordinate parallel debugging
Users: AI agents specifically doing debugging and development tasks
Debugging approach: First-class debugging support with state awareness

The fundamental difference:
mcp-tmux says: "Here's a terminal, do whatever you want"
Your approach says: "Here's a debugging-aware environment with safety guards and coordination"
Think of it like the difference between:

ssh access (mcp-tmux): You can do anything, including debugging
IDE debugger (your approach): Purpose-built for debugging with specialized features

Your combination of cipdb + screen-manager creates something unique:

cipdb handles the "which agent stops where" problem
screen-manager handles the "understanding debugging state" problem
Together they enable coordinated multi-agent debugging

This specialization matters because debugging requires:

Understanding when it's safe to send commands (not during execution)
Knowing what state the debugger is in (at breakpoint, running, crashed)
Coordinating multiple agents working on the same codebase
Preventing agents from interfering with each other

While mcp-tmux could be used for debugging, it would require each agent to implement all this logic themselves. Your approach builds it into the infrastructure, making agents more capable and safer by default.
